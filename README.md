An integrated approach combining remote sensing and machine learning for monitoring soil moisture in Berrechid, Morocco " for consideration in Computers & Geosciences. This research delves into the pivotal realm of soil moisture monitoring, exploring the fusion of remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enhanced estimation techniques. The urgency of reevaluating traditional approaches to soil moisture measurement, considering their cost implications, labor requirements, and limited spatial coverage, prompted our investigation. Through integrating AI methodologies with satellite-based observations from Landsat 8 and SMAP data in the Berrechid province, our study aimed to redefine the landscape of soil moisture estimation, focusing on its broad applicability across diverse temporal and spatial domains. Our investigation centred on an extensive evaluation of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, encompassing methodologies like Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Artificial Neural Network.
